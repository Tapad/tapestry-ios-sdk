This sample project shows how to integrate Tapestry with Google Analytics. The CuteAnimal project is the sample from Google Analytics v3 for iOS, plus with Tapestry web analytics enabled.

Follow the standard setup instructions for the Tapestry SDK in the parent project, then set your Google Analytics tracking ID in the variable `kTrackingId` in AppDelegate.m.
